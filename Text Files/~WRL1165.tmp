Our Process
Our Project 3 Final started with the Circle Blaster Homework from our homework. Because we are both massive nerds and into a podcast called The Adventure Zone, we decided to base our final project around this shared interest. The Big Bad of our game is something called The Hunger which consumes entire planes of existence in an everlasting search for something called the Light of Creation. It was the role of the IPRE and their ship to capture The Light as often as possible to prevent The Hunger from gaining more power.
We started by modifying the homework to continuously spawn circles at the bottom of the screen and to have them drift upwards and de-spawn when they got out of range. After that we took away the ship’s shooting capabilities. This is because the role the player fills is one of self-preservation, not aggression.
The next major change was to color the circles a bunch of beautiful rainbow colors and add the swirling mass of darkness at the bottom of the screen (see the moveInCircle method in the Circle class) to represent The Hunger. We also made the particle speed and spawn rate increase every time The Hunger consume The Light of Creation. Circle collisions were subbed in for rectangle collisions because they are FancyTM. At this point, we were mostly done with everything related to the way The Hunger was going to work.
After this we started working with The Light of Creation. The first step was to make it exist in the first place, done through its own personal LightofCreation class. The class operated in a similar manner to the Circle class for The Hunger particles.
