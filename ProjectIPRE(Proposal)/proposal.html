      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
          <p>
                The player must navigate around the screen using WASD controls and avoid the colorful circles while attempting to capture a bright white object called the Light of Creation.
                
                If the player retrieves the light, they recieve a temporary power up.
                
                If it falls past the bottom of the canvas, the Hunger consumes it and gains a permanent increase in both projectile speed and spawn rate.

                The objective of the game is to last as long as possible before succumbing to The Hunger.
            </p>
      
        <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p><b>Keyboard:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Enter: Start Game</li>
                <li>WASD: Movement</li>

        <h3>User Onboarding</h3>
            <p>
                This game is based off of a podcast called <i>The Adventure Zone</i> which is where a large majority of the userbase will come from.

                Therefor, it is not unreasonable to expect most users to understand the base story behind the game. However for those unfamiliar with the lore, there is a Game Guide which explains the premise of the game and how to play.

                
            </p>
        <h3>Player Learning</h3>
            <p>
                It is reasonable to expect the average user to be familiar with basic game mechanics such as WASD navigation and the concept of evading enemies.

                The basic controls are explained through the Game Guide screen.
                
                The game starts out very easy so that users can learn the controls and experiment a little bit before the difficulty picks up.
